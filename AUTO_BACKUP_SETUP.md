# 🚀 Auto-Backup Setup Instructions

## ✅ Step 1: GitHub Token Already Set!

Your GitHub token is already configured in the `.env` file:
```
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## 🔒 Step 2: Secure Environment Setup

✅ **Token Security Implemented:**
- Token stored in `.env` file (not in code)
- `.env` file added to `.gitignore` (won't be committed)
- Environment variables loaded via `react-native-dotenv`
- **No APK rebuild required** - works with OTA updates!

## 🚀 Step 3: Deploy via OTA

Just run your OTA update command:
```bash
npm run ota
```

**That's it!** No APK rebuild needed.

## ✅ How It Works

### Automatic Backup:
- **Every 3 minutes** the app checks if data changed
- **If changed** → automatically pushes backup to `hlm_backup_private` repo
- **Silent operation** → no interruption to user workflow

### Manual Control:
- **Toggle button** to enable/disable auto-backup
- **"Backup Now"** button for immediate backup
- **"Test Connection"** to verify GitHub access
- **Status display** showing last backup time and any errors

### Safety Features:
- ✅ **No interference** with existing local storage
- ✅ **Network-aware** → only backs up when online
- ✅ **Change detection** → only backs up when data actually changed
- ✅ **Error handling** → retries on failure, shows user feedback
- ✅ **Separate storage** → uses different AsyncStorage keys

## 🎯 Repository Structure

Your backup will be saved as:
```
hlm_backup_private/
└── auto-backup.json
```

Each backup creates a new commit with message:
```
Auto-backup 2025-09-06 14:30:25
```

## 🔧 User Interface

The backup screen now shows:
```
🔄 Auto-Backup to GitHub
├─ Auto-backup ON/OFF [Toggle Button]
├─ 📍 Frequency: Every 3 minutes when data changes
├─ 🕒 Last backup: [timestamp]
├─ [Backup Now] [Test Connection]
└─ Status messages for errors/retries
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Keep token secure** → Don't share or commit it to code
2. **Private repo** → Your backup data stays private
3. **No APK rebuild** → Works with existing OTA system
4. **Existing backups unchanged** → All current backup methods still work
5. **Safe implementation** → If auto-backup fails, local storage is unaffected

## 🎉 Ready to Use!

After setting the token and running OTA update:
1. Open app → Go to Backup & Restore screen
2. Toggle "Auto-backup" to ON
3. App will automatically backup every 3 minutes when data changes
4. Check GitHub repo to see backup commits

Your uncle can now work normally, and the app will automatically keep backups in GitHub without any manual intervention!
